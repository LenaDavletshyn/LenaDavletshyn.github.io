              This role centered on developing way finding systems for a newly
              planned city. This included designing signage layouts,
              conceptualizing and strategizing their implementation, defining
              usability standards, and establishing feasibility guidelines. My
              primary focus was within the mobility sector, ensuring seamless
              navigation and accessibility. Additionally, I was responsible for
              crafting UX strategies and designing UI visuals for a website.

              As a UX/UI designer, I created a seamless project management
              interface through data analysis, user interviews, and iterative
              prototyping (Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi). I collaborated with an external
              development company, using empirical evidence and user behavior
              patterns to guide design decisions. The final platform was both
              functional and visually appealing, earning positive feedback from
              users and stakeholders.
              <br /><br />
              As a UI Designer for road simulation software, I overhauled the
              information architecture and improved usability by optimizing
              existing elements for a more user-friendly experience. I worked
              with a large driving-safety-oriented database to support scenario
              creation for diverse road scenes. The software was designed to
              reduce client time and costs by enabling rapid generation of
              multiple scenarios.
